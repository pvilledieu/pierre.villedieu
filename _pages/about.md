I am a PhD student in Economics at [Sciences Po Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en.html). My research interests are in labor economics and applied econometrics with a special focus on discrimination related issues and the evaluation of active labor market policies. I am working under the supervision of Pr [Pierre Cahuc](https://sites.google.com/site/pierrecahuc/).

As part of my thesis I am also involved in projects with the statistical service of the french ministry of Labor ([Dares](https://dares.travail-emploi.gouv.fr)). I am also affiliated to the [LIEPP](https://www.sciencespo.fr/liepp/en/users/pierrevilledieu.html).
