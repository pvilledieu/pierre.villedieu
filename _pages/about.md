I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from [Sciences Po Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en.html). My research focuses on labor economics and the evaluation of public policies, with a particular interest in the labor market integration of disadvantaged populations and issues related to discrimination.

I am currently working at the statistical service of the French ministry of Labor, [Dares](https://dares.travail-emploi.gouv.fr)).
