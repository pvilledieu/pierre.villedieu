I hold a PhD in Economics from [Sciences Po Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en.html). My research interests are in labor economics and public policies evaluation with a particular focus on the labor market integration of disadvantaged people and discrimination related issues.

I am currently working at the statistical service of the French ministry of Labor ([Dares](https://dares.travail-emploi.gouv.fr))).
