<h3>The Lock-In Effects of Part-Time Unemployment Benefits.</h3>
with <i>[Helène Benghalem](https://sites.google.com/view/helenebenghalem/home) and [Pierre Cahuc](https://sites.google.com/site/pierrecahuc/)</i>

> <div style="text-align: justify"> We ran a large randomized controlled experiment among about 150,000 recipients of unemployment benefits insurance in France in order to evaluate the impact of part-time unemployment benefits. We took advantage of the lack of knowledge of job seekers regarding this program and sent emails presenting the program. The information provision had a significant positive impact on the propensity to work while on claim, but reduced the unemployment exit rate, showing important lock-in effects into unemployment associated with part-time unemployment benefits. The extension of the duration of compensated unemployment counterbalanced the increase in the number of days worked while on claim so that the net expenditure of unemployment insurance remained unchanged. </div>

<h3>The benefits of early work experience for school dropouts: Evidence from a field experiment.</h3>
with <i>[Jérémy Hervelin](http://www.jeremy-hervelin.fr)</i>

> <div style="text-align: justify"> School dropouts face long-lasting negative effects on the labor market with increasing unemployment rate in the early life. This paper aims at analyzing the effect of a one-year job-related experience via a subsidized job program after young people dropped out of school. Relying on an correspondence study field experiment, we examine the consequences on the chances of having job interviews in France. We find that the chances to be invited for an interview are more than doubled (from 7.6% to 19.3%) when applicants signal a one-year work experience in their résumé - either certified or not; either in the market or non-market sector-, in comparison with youths who remained mainly inactive after dropping out from high school. We show that this effect is quite stable across firm, contract or labor market characteristics and it is robust to another channel of application where résumés were sent spontaneously to firms. </div>

<h3>The Role of Caseworkers in the Labor Market Integration of Young Unemployed: Evidence from France.</h3>
with <i>[Jérémy Hervelin](http://www.jeremy-hervelin.fr)</i>


> <div style="text-align: justify"> About 13% of young people aged 15–29-year-old were not in employment, education, or training (NEET) in OECD countries in 2019. As a part of the public employment services, the Mission Locales agencies are specially dedicated to young people who face major labor market integration issues in France. We propose to use the quasi-random allocation of caseworkers to youths to study how caseworkers can affect the future trajectories of young unemployed. Preliminary evidence show that caseworkers with higher placement rates in a formalized job search assistance program positively affect the employment outcomes of youths: top tercile caseworkers are found to increase youths' total number of days of employment by about 11 days two years after their first meeting with a youth, which corresponds to a 5% increase, in comparison with bottom tercile caseworkers. </div>
