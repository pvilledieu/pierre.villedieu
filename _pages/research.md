## Working Papers

Helène Benghalem, Pierre Cahuc, and Pierre Villedieu. "The Lock-In Effects of Part-Time Unemployment Benefits."

> We ran a large randomized controlled experiment among about 150,000 recipients of unemployment benefits insurance in France in order to evaluate the impact of part-time unemployment benefits. We took advantage of the lack of knowledge of job seekers regarding this program and sent emails presenting the program. The information provision had a significant positive impact on the propensity to work while on claim, but reduced the unemployment exit rate, showing important lock-in effects into unemployment associated with part-time unemployment benefits. The extension of the duration of compensated unemployment counterbalanced the increase in the number of days worked while on claim so that the net expenditure of unemployment insurance remained unchanged.

## Work in Progress

Jérémy Hervelin and Pierre Villedieu. "The benefits of early work experience for school dropouts: Evidence from a field experiment"

<div style="text-align: justify"> School dropouts face long-lasting negative effects on the labor market with increasing unemployment rate in the early life. This paper aims at analyzing the effect of a one-year job-related experience via a subsidized job program after young people dropped out of school. Relying on an correspondence study field experiment, we examine the consequences on the chances of having job interviews in France. We find that the chances to be invited for an interview are more than doubled (from 7.6% to 19.3%) when applicants signal a one-year work experience in their résumé - either certified or not; either in the market or non-market sector-, in comparison with youths who remained mainly inactive after dropping out from high school. We show that this effect is quite stable across firm, contract or labor market characteristics and it is robust to another channel of application where résumés were sent spontaneously to firms. </div>
